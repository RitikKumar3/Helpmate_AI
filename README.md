# ü§ñ Helpmate AI (RAG Pipeline)
- In this project, we build a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline** that enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to provide **accurate, factual, and context-aware answers** by retrieving relevant information from a custom knowledge base.

---

## Project Background
> LLMs can sometimes provide incomplete or hallucinated responses when asked about specific domains or datasets.  
> **Helpmate AI** bridges this gap by combining **information retrieval** and **text generation**, ensuring that the chatbot or assistant provides responses that are **grounded in real data** and **tailored to the query context**.

---

## Problem Statement
> Build a **three-layered RAG pipeline** that:
- Ingests and processes documents to create a searchable knowledge base.
- Retrieves and ranks the most relevant text chunks using semantic search.
- Generates an **accurate and contextually enriched answer** by combining retrieved data and LLM capabilities.

---

## System Design
The **Helpmate AI** pipeline consists of the following layers:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Embedding Layer
- Ingests documents and splits them into manageable text chunks.
- Uses an **embedding model** (OpenAI, HuggingFace, or Sentence Transformers) to convert text into high-dimensional vectors.
- Stores these embeddings in a **vector database** for fast semantic search.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Search and Rank Layer
- Performs **semantic similarity search** on the knowledge base.
- Retrieves the **top K closest chunks** that best match the user query.
- Returns the text passages and their respective indices for processing.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Generation Layer
- Combines:
  - The **original user query**
  - The **retrieved text chunks**
  - A **well-structured prompt**
- Sends this enriched context to an LLM to generate a **coherent, factual, and contextually relevant answer**.

---

## Approach
- **Document Ingestion:** Load, clean, and prepare dataset or knowledge base files.
- **Chunking:** Break large text documents into smaller segments for better embedding.
- **Vector Embedding:** Convert text chunks into vectors using a pre-trained embedding model.
- **Vector Store Creation:** Store embeddings for efficient similarity search.
- **Semantic Search:** Retrieve top K most relevant text chunks for a query.
- **LLM Generation:** Feed retrieved context and query into an LLM for improved, factual answers.

## Future Work
- Experiment with **hybrid search** (semantic + keyword-based retrieval) for better accuracy.
- Deploy **Helpmate AI** as a REST API or **chatbot interface** for real-time use.
- Add **dynamic document updates and re-indexing** for evolving knowledge bases.
- Integrate **multi-modal RAG** (text + image embeddings) for richer information retrieval.
